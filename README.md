## Introduction

This project is thought as an interface for people that is visually impaired to use some of the features of ChatGPT. The interface is made so the person can use it as an assistant to ask questions and interact completely to ChatGPT. 
Thinking about providing other ways to help it interacts with dalee to generate images, more thinking about a place where they can make things happen for the people that work in marketing and idea development to translate ideas into pictures and present them. 
Translate from spanish to english anything that they have, could be from themselves, or any video they have from Spanish to English.

## How to use it

As soon as you run the program it will interact with you through voice and wait for your commands which are the following:

### Asistente

The user will said "Asistente". This feature will ask them what they need help with, and contact ChatGPT to provide the information that it has and answer all the queries the user have. Due to time was not able to provide more actions to do, but well the sky is the limit, it can help code, write emails, all and then connect with the programs that are needed to send this information. This mode will be open until the user provide the voice input "salir". This will drive the user to the main interface.

### Imagen

The user will say "Imagen". This feature will ask them what they want to draw and the style they want of it. It will provide the image in the screen. Again due to time this was not exploited as expected to save it or even email it. Looking also to provide a description of the image done so they can know if it was as expected. This will run only once and going back to the main interface.

### Traductor

The user will say "Traductor". This feature will ask from a list of languages which one they want to translate from to english, current only supported language of ChatGPT. This is also thought to receive the input from the mic, so they can put any video, ad, movie they hear to know what is it saying. This will run only once and going back to the main interface.



## Future work 

Make an smooth flow between the modes so they can be even transparent for the user to have a better Natural interaction. Exploit the usage of models and training of them so it could be more useful and accurate for the needs of the user. 

Add functionalities describe on some of the modules that are not being solved due to time and also knowledge limitations of the developer
